# DNS & Email Security + Data Protection (Quick Notes)

## DNS Spoofing
- Fake DNS response sent to victim
- Redirects user to malicious IP
- Usually temporary
- Mitigation: DNSSEC, DoH/DoT, IDS

---

## DNS Cache Poisoning
- Malicious DNS record stored in DNS cache
- Persistent redirection
- Leads to phishing, malware, MITM
- Mitigation: DNSSEC, source port randomization

---

## DNSSEC
- Adds cryptographic trust to DNS
- Prevents spoofing & poisoning
- Uses digital signatures
- Does NOT encrypt traffic

---

## DNSSEC Keys
### KSK (Key Signing Key)
- Signs DNSKEY records
- Rarely rotated
- Creates chain of trust
- Hash stored as DS record in parent zone

### ZSK (Zone Signing Key)
- Signs DNS records (A, MX, TXT)
- Frequently rotated
- No parent zone involvement

---

## DMARC
- Protects against email spoofing
- Uses SPF + DKIM
- Enforces policy via DNS TXT record

### DMARC Policies
- p=none → monitor
- p=quarantine → spam
- p=reject → block

---

## SPF
- Authorizes sending mail servers
- Prevents sender spoofing
- Stored in DNS TXT record

---

## DKIM
- Digitally signs email content
- Ensures message integrity
- Uses public/private key pair

---

## Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- Prevents sensitive data exfiltration
- Protects PII, PHI, IP

### DLP Types
- Network DLP → data in transit
- Endpoint DLP → USB, copy/paste
- Cloud DLP → SaaS apps

### Actions
- Block, alert, encrypt, log

---

## Real-World Chain
DNS Attack → Fake Site → Credential Theft → Data Exfil Attempt → DLP Block

---

## Exam Memory Hooks
- DNS redirect → DNS attack
- Email spoofing → DMARC
- Stop data leaving → DLP
- Trust in DNS → DNSSEC
