- **EOL**: Product no longer sold/updated → security risk.  
- **EOSL**: Vendor stops all support → must replace or isolate.  
- **Legacy Platform**: Old system still in use → often vulnerable.  
- **VM Sprawl**: Too many VMs → harder to manage, bigger attack surface.  
- **VM Escape**: Attack breaks VM → host/system compromised.  
- **Jailbreaking**: Removes device restrictions → security weakened.  
- **Side Loading**: Install apps outside store → higher malware risk.
