Today I practiced working with REST APIs.

I learned how clients send requests to an API and how servers return responses.  
I created simple examples of GET and POST requests to show how data is retrieved and how new data is sent to a server.

This helped me understand:
- How API requests work
- How servers respond with data
- Common HTTP status codes
