# Password Spraying & Credential Stuffing (Malware-Driven Attacks)

## Overview
Credential-based attacks are commonly used as **initial access** techniques and are often supported by malware such as **infostealers**, **botnets**, and **ransomware loaders**.

---

## Password Spraying

### Definition
Attempts **one common password** across **many user accounts** to avoid lockouts.

### Common Passwords
- Welcome123
- Password1
- Winter2026!
- Company@123

### Why It Works
- Weak password policies
- Default credentials
- No MFA

### Malware Association
- Botnets
- Malware loaders
- Initial Access Trojans

### MITRE ATT&CK
- `T1110.003 – Password Spraying`

---

## Credential Stuffing

### Definition
Uses **previously stolen username/password pairs** across multiple services.

### Credential Sources
- Data breaches
- Infostealer malware
- Dark web dumps

### Why It Works
- Password reuse
- Lack of MFA

### Malware Association
- Infostealers
- Banking Trojans
- Ransomware affiliates

### MITRE ATT&CK
- `T1110.004 – Credential Stuffing`

## Malware Enabling These Attacks

### Infostealer Malware
Steals credentials, cookies, and session tokens from endpoints.

**Examples**
- RedLine
- Raccoon
- Vidar

---

### Botnets
Automate large-scale login attempts using distributed IPs.

**Examples**
- Mirai variants
- Phorpiex

---

## Detection Indicators

### Logs & Alerts
- Multiple failed logins across many users
- Same password used repeatedly
- Logins from new countries or ASNs
- Impossible travel events

---

## Prevention & Mitigation

- Enforce MFA
- Strong password policies
- Disable breached passwords
- Rate limiting & CAPTCHA
- Monitor auth logs via SIEM
- Endpoint scans for infostealers

---

## Incident Response Actions

1. Identify compromised accounts
2. Force password resets
3. Revoke sessions & tokens
4. Scan endpoints for malware
5. Monitor for lateral movement
6. Watch for ransomware staging

---

## Key Takeaway
**Password Spraying:** One password → many users  
**Credential Stuffing:** Many stolen creds → many sites
