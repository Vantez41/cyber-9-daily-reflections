compare and contrast cryptographic algorithms
explain the difference between public key infastructure and digital certificates
there are three algorithms Hash,Symmetric and asymmetric and digital signatures
Symmetric consists of single key encrypts and decrypts, asymmetric uses a public and private key pair, Hashing is use for integrity and digital signatures signs hash message with private key and validate with public key
