what i learned today were the key components of the three different types of cabling. By using a media converter allowing different mediums to interact
the only difficulty that arised was being able to distinguish between using a token ring or ethernet and arch system..
that problem was resolved by understanding the differences of all which further concluded that the ethernet version was more effective via cost and speed also equipted with carrier sense multtple access.
Next i focus on implementing the effiecientcy of the setups depending on network size and purpose
